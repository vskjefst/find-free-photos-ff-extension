# Find Free Photos Firefox Extension

The Find Free Photos Firefox Extensions let's you quickly search some of the internet's _legal_ sources for free, high quality, royalty free photos.

The extension can be instaled from the Firefox add-ons repository: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/find-free-photos/.

## Usage

Open a new windows or tab, and enter the following in the address bar: `ffp KEYWORDS`

Example:

`ffp mountain range`

This will open a few new tabs, and search for your keywords on the photo sites the extension currently supports. Easy as pie. Please note that the extension is dumb as a rock, so it won't reuse the same tabs the if you do a new search. Instead, new tabs will be opened.

## Supported sites

* Pexels
* Unsplash
* Pixabay
* Kaboompics
