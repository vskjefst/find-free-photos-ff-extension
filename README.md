# Find Free Photos Firefox Extension

The Find Free Photos Firefox Extensions let's you quickly search some of the internet's _legal_ sources for free, high quality, royalty free photos.

The extension can be instaled from the Firefox add-ons repository: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/find-free-photos/.

## Usage

Open a new windows or tab, and enter the following in the address bar: `ffp KEYWORDS`

Example:

`ffp mountain range`

This will open a few new tabs, and search for your keywords on the photo sites the extension currently supports. Easy as pie. The plugin will reuse tabs it has already created if they've not been closed manually.

## Supported sites

* Pexels
* Unsplash
* Pixabay
* Canva
* StockSnap.io
* Burst
